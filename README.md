# tarot_ai_algorythm
project about simulating the process of divination

This code will simulate, a draw from tarot cards deck, then compare "interpret" the meaning of cards and generate a "future prediction".

I used t5flan from transformers as generative model.

In order to run this code you need to have a transformers library installed.

# bugs
Sometimes the model's (t5) output is completly mumble with no sense at all.
